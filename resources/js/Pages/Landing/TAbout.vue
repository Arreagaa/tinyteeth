                    Tiny Teeth is a pediatric dental practice catering to the
                    needs of children and young adults. We believe that every
                    child should be treated with care and respect as if they
                    were our own. Our goal is to make every patient’s experience
                    so positive that they will love to come back to see us and
                    ultimately become adults with no dental fears. We also love
                    watching them grow!
                </p>

                    Tiny Teeth opened its doors in 2010 and quickly became the
                    best pediatric dental office in town. Dr Patricia Pina and
                    her staff have more than 20 years of experience and will
                    take the best care of your children’s teeth.
