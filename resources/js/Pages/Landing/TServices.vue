                        In order to prevent dental problems, your child should
                        come see us when the first tooth appears, or no later
                        than his/her first birthday and every six months. We
                        provide all the information needed to keep children
                        cavity free or we will treat any dental problems until
                        age 18. In our office, we perform x-rays, cleanings,
                        sealants, tooth-colored fillings, silver diamine
                        fluoride, crowns, extractions, space maintainer and
                        habit appliances. We offer nitrous oxide (laughing gas).
                        When a patient is very young, has dental anxiety or
                        severe dental disease, we have the option to treat them
                        at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital under general anesthesia.
